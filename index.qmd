I currently study at UC San Diego within the MSBA program and am currently 
looking for a full-time job to be a Data/Business Analyst. With an undergraduate 
at UC San Diego in Mathematics: Probability & Statistics, I strive to apply 
my statistics background when analyzing data trends and ultimately providing 
data-driven business decisions.
